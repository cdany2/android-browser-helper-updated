# Android Browser Helper

The Android Browser Helper library helps developers use Custom Tabs and Trusted
Web Activities on top of the AndroidX browser support library.
It contains default implementations of many of the common tasks a
developer will find themselves requiring, for example:

* Creating a Launcher Activity that simply launches a Trusted Web Activity.
* Code for choosing an appropriate Custom Tabs provider.
* Creating an Activity to launch the browser's site settings for a TWA.
